# 🧮 Sprint 12 — Numerical Methods

**Project Title:** Predicting Used Car Prices (Rusty Bargain)

---

## 🎯 Goal
Build and compare regression models to predict used car prices while balancing prediction accuracy, training time, and inference speed.

---

## 💡 Why It Matters
In real-world applications, the best model is not always the most accurate one. Businesses must consider computational cost and response time when deploying machine learning solutions at scale.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Prepare and preprocess structured tabular data  
- Train multiple regression models  
- Compare accuracy, training time, and prediction speed  
- Select an optimal model based on business constraints  

---

## 🛠️ Methods & Techniques
- Feature preprocessing  
- Baseline regression modeling  
- Decision Tree & Random Forest regression  
- Gradient boosting (LightGBM)  
- Model benchmarking and comparison  

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- Training time  
- Prediction speed  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- pandas  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- LightGBM  
- Jupyter Notebook
