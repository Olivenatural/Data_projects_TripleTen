# 🚗📈 Predicting Used Car Prices with Machine Learning

I explore how different regression models perform under real-world business constraints,
balancing **prediction accuracy, training time, and inference speed**.

This project simulates a production decision where the “best” model is not always the most complex one.

🏷️ **Tech Stack:** Python · pandas ·  -learn · LightGBM · Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 01 — Problem Statement

Rusty Bargain needs fast and reliable used-car price estimates.
The challenge is selecting a model that performs well **without excessive computational cost**.

---

## 🎯 02 — Project Goals

- Prepare and preprocess structured tabular data  
- Train multiple regression models  
- Compare accuracy, training time, and prediction speed
