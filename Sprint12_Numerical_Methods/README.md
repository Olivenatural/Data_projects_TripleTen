# 🧮 Sprint 12 — Numerical Methods

**Project Title:** Predicting Used Car Prices (Rusty Bargain)

I explore how different regression models perform under real-world business constraints —
balancing **accuracy, training time, and prediction speed**.

This project simulates a production decision where the “best” model is not always the most complex one.

🏷️ **Tech Stack:** Python · pandas · scikit-learn · LightGBM · Jupyter
