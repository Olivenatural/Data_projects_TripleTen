## 🎯 01 — Project Overview  

This final project brings together everything learned throughout the program into a single, end-to-end machine learning workflow.  

The focus is not only on model performance, but on making practical, business-aware decisions around data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and next steps toward production.  

This project demonstrates my ability to think like a wellness-focused data scientist, balancing accuracy, interpretability, and real-world constraints.  

---

## 🧠 02 — Business Problem  

The goal of this project is to solve a real-world predictive problem using historical data while answering key business questions:  

- What data is reliable enough to support decision-making?  
- Which modeling approach balances accuracy and performance constraints?  
- How can insights be communicated clearly to non-technical stakeholders?  

---

## 📦 03 — Dataset Overview  

- Historical structured dataset  
- Includes numerical and categorical features  
- Contains missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies typical of real-world data  
- Target variable selected based on business relevance  

The dataset required extensive cleaning and validation before modeling.  

---

## 🧹 04 — Data Cleaning & Preparation  

Key preparation steps included:  

- Handling missing values using meaningful placeholders  
- Normalizing inconsistent categorical labels  
- Removing duplicate rows created by timestamp removal  
- Filtering unrealistic or invalid values  
- Grouping rare categories to reduce noise  

Each decision was made to reduce bias and improve generalization, not just to satisfy technical requirements.  

---

## 🔍 05 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

Exploratory analysis was used to:  

- Understand feature distributions  
- Identify outliers and data quality issues  
- Validate assumptions before modeling  
- Support preprocessing decisions visually  

Visualizations were used to justify why specific rows or values were removed.  

---

## 🤖 06 — Model Training & Evaluation  

Multiple models were trained and evaluated using consistent metrics.  

Evaluation focused on:  

- Predictive performance  
- Generalization ability  
- Computational efficiency  
- Interpretability for business stakeholders  

Models were compared side-by-side to identify tradeoffs rather than chasing a single metric.

## 🧠 08 — Approach & Methodology  

The project followed a structured, repeatable workflow:  

- Data validation and cleaning  
- Exploratory analysis to guide decisions  
- Feature preparation  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Business-focused interpretation  

This approach mirrors how machine learning projects operate in production environments.  

---

## 💡 09 — Key Takeaways  

- Model selection is a business decision, not just a technical one.  
- Performance constraints strongly influence which models are practical in production.  

---

## 🚀 10 — Next Steps & Improvements  

- Feature selection and refinement  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Production-level inference testing  
- Monitoring performance drift over time
