# ⏱ Sprint 13 — Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

---

## 🎯 Goal
Analyze time-dependent data to identify trends and patterns and build forecasting models using time-aware validation strategies.

---

## 💡 Why It Matters
Time series data requires special handling. Improper validation can lead to data leakage and overly optimistic results, making models unreliable in production.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Explore temporal patterns in historical data  
- Engineer time-based features  
- Build forecasting models  
- Apply realistic train/validation splits  

---

## 🛠️ Methods & Techniques
- Time series exploratory analysis  
- Lag features and rolling statistics  
- Baseline forecasting models  
- Time-based train/validation splitting  

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
